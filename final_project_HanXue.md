## This is the outline of my final project
# my one setence discriptor: Suicide is closer to us than we thought.
Mental health is more important than many of us perceived. Sometimes we are not that healthy, and suicide is actually very close to us.

# The story arc
First I will show the overall suicide rate around the globe. I want to use some vivid visualization that shows the rate is actually pretty high. And then pick several countries with high suicide rates, to state the point one step forward. 
The audience might be wondering what kind of person is more likely to commit suicide. I will analyze some factors that could be related to suicide rate. Income, gender, income group of country etc. 
How to manage mental health and keep away from suicide? I can use some examples to talk about some coping strtegies, and the improvement those would bring to mental health.

# Plan for the final project
I think I will be using Shorthand, but I am still getting used to it now.

# The data
I started with suicide data from WHO, the link is [here](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MENTALHEALTH?lang=en) 
I am still working on other data for coping strategies, will update here later.
